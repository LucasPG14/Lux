# Lux

Lux is a rendering engine created from scratch using OpenGL and C++ for my final degree project at the UPC-CITM. In this engine, we find implementations of different Global Illumination techniques.

The basis of this project was made following [TheCherno's](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheChernoProject) [Game Engine Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT) playlist.

## Goal

The aim of this project is to implement some of the different Global Illumination software techniques that currently exist and to carry out a study between them, analysing performance and memory consumption.

Another goal of this project is to improve my knowledge of graphics programming, creating an optimal and efficient rendering engine.

## How to use Lux

In order to use Lux, you must download the repository and run the file called Generate.bat to generate the projects and the Visual Studio solution.

Lux uses several open source libraries. Here I will leave a link to all of them:
