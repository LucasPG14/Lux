# Lux

Lux is a final degree project at the UPC, corresponding to the Video Game Design and Development degree.

The basis of the project was made following this [YouTube series]() by [TheCherno]().

## Goal

The aim of this project is to implement some of the different Global Illumination software techniques that currently exist and to carry out a study between them, analysing performance and memory consumption.
